# Yijin Wang
I am Yijin Wang, a first-year PhD student at American University.
I'm working in the lab of Prof. Bei Xiao, and we are investigating how human brain perceives materials in different dimensions, using a combination of machine learning and neuroscience methods.
What we are recently interested in is how human memorize different kinds of materials, and we are still investigating this.
