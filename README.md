# Bio
I am Yijin Wang (王仪瑾), a first-year PhD student at American University. I'm working in the lab of Prof. Bei Xiao, and we are investigating how human brain perceives materials in different dimensions, using a combination of machine learning and neuroscience methods. What we are recently interested in is how human memorize different kinds of materials, and we are still investigating this.
